Computer science provides an in-depth understanding of technical and mathematical aspects of
programming concepts such as monads, but there is more to monads. If we want to understand how 
programming concepts evolve, how programmers think about them and how they are used in practice, 
we need to consider a broader perspective that includes historical, philosophical and cognitive 
aspects. In this paper, we develop such broader understanding of monads -- a programming concept that 
got into programming from category theory, has language support in several languages and has 
a reputation for being elegant and powerful, but also intimidating and difficult to understand. 
We review the history of monads in the context of programming and study the development
through the perspectives of philosophy of science and mathematics, as well as cognitive sciences.

We develop a framework for understanding programming concepts that considers them at three levels:
formal, metaphorical and implementation. 
Our observations are based on established results about the scientific method and mathematical 
entities -- cognitive sciences suggest that the metaphors used when thinking about monads
are more important than widely accepted, while philosophy of science explains how the research 
paradigm from which monads originate influences and restricts their use. 
Finally, we provide evidence for why a broader philosophical, sociological look at programming concepts 
should be of interest for programmers. It lets us understand programming concepts better and, 
fundamentally, choose more appropriate abstractions as illustrated in a number of case studies
that conclude the paper.
